# Privacy Policy for Mangala App

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the MANGALA application (collectively, the “application” located at App Store and Google Play). MANGALA, the provider of the Application (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.

#### Please read this privacy policy carefully. By accessing or using our application, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by all the terms of this privacy policy and our application terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms, exit this application and do not access or use the application.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.

## Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information

### Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the application, such as sending us feedback, requesting information about our services, or signing up for special offers, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. However, if you choose to engage in these activities, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and date of birth. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Application, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

## Release of Personally Identifiable Information

We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:

1. **Authorized Third Party Service Providers**: We provide services and products through third parties who perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails.

2. **Business Transfer**: As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.

3. **Protection of Rights**: We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Application; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Application Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Application, its Users, or others.

## Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates, and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with Third Party Advertisers or Third Party Advertising Companies and other parties as provided below.

## Security of Information

We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. Your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.

## Data Tracking

We may use other industry-standard technologies to track your use of our Application or allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf.

## Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on the Mangala application. Other websites that may be accessible through this Application have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you to review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.

## Children

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 6, and no part of the Application is designed to attract anyone under the age of 6.
