This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the SELF GROWTH application (collectively, the “application” located at App Store, Google Play). SELF GROWTH the provider of the Application (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.

Please read this privacy policy carefully. By accessing or using our application, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound to all the terms of this privacy policy and our application terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms, exit this application and do not access or use the application.

Changes to Privacy Policy If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.

Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information We collect two types of information about our Application Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally Identifiable Information . Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the application, such as creating an account, download free file, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information . Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID).

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Application, analyse trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.

Release of Personally Identifiable Information We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:

We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers . We provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails.

We may share your information in a Business Transfer . As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.

We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others . We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Application; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Application Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Application, its Users or others.

Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “Third Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties as provided below:

We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you use our Application. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other application in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that Admob. If you would like more information about any Admob Google company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising from any Admob company, click here:

We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyse Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our application and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.

Updating and Correcting Information We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information by logging into your account and accessing the “Setting” section of the application, or by contacting us through “Contact”. We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Application. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup information.

User Choices on Collection and Use of Information As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.

As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by submitting a request at beemob.daoducanh@gmail.com, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails.

In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Application, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
